# JCoDroneEdu Flight Patterns

Educational flight patterns library wi## üéØ Implementation Notes

### **Python-Matching Implementation**

The flight patterns in this library **exactly match the Python implementation** using the same `sendControl()` and `sendControlWhile()` methods for direct motor control.

**Python Implementation:**
```python
def square(self, speed=60, seconds=1, direction=1):
    power = int(speed)
    duration = int(seconds * 1000)
    self.sendControlWhile(0, power, 0, 0, duration)        # Forward
    self.sendControlWhile(0, -power, 0, 0, 50)             # Brief stop
    self.sendControlWhile(power * direction, 0, 0, 0, duration)  # Right/left
    # ... continues with exact same pattern

def triangle(self, speed=60, seconds=1, direction=1):
    power = int(speed)
    duration = int(seconds * 1000)
    self.sendControlWhile(power * direction, power, 0, 0, duration)    # Diagonal
    self.sendControlWhile(-power * direction, -power, 0, 0, 50)        # Brief stop
    # ... continues with exact same pattern

def sway(self, speed=30, seconds=2, direction=1):
    power = int(speed)
    duration = int(seconds * 1000)
    for i in range(2):
        self.sendControlWhile(-power * direction, 0, 0, 0, duration)
        self.sendControlWhile(power * direction, 0, 0, 0, duration)

def spiral(self, speed=50, seconds=5, direction=1):
    power = int(speed)
    self.sendControl(0, power, 100 * -direction, -power)
    time.sleep(seconds)

def circle(self, speed=75, direction=1):
    self.sendControl(0, speed, direction * speed, 0)
    time.sleep(5)
```

**Java Implementation (Direct Match):**
```java
public void square(int speed, int seconds, int direction) {
    int power = speed;
    int duration = seconds * 1000;
    sendControlWhile(0, power, 0, 0, duration);        // Forward
    sendControlWhile(0, -power, 0, 0, 50);             // Brief stop
    sendControlWhile(power * direction, 0, 0, 0, duration);  // Right/left
    // ... continues with exact same pattern

public void triangle(int speed, int seconds, int direction) {
    int power = speed;
    int duration = seconds * 1000;
    sendControlWhile(power * direction, power, 0, 0, duration);    // Diagonal
    sendControlWhile(-power * direction, -power, 0, 0, 50);        // Brief stop
    // ... continues with exact same pattern

public void sway(int speed, int seconds, int direction) {
    int power = speed;
    int duration = seconds * 1000;
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        sendControlWhile(-power * direction, 0, 0, 0, duration);
        sendControlWhile(power * direction, 0, 0, 0, duration);
    }
}

public void spiral(int speed, int seconds, int direction) {
    int power = speed;
    sendControl(0, power, 100 * -direction, -power);
    Thread.sleep(seconds * 1000);
}

public void circle(int speed, int direction, double duration) {
    sendControl(0, speed, direction * speed, 0);
    Thread.sleep((long)(duration * 1000));
}

        advancedDrone.hexagon(40, 70);         // 40cm sides, 70% speed
        
        // Python-style smooth methods (advanced students)  
        advancedDrone.pentagonSmooth(60, 2, 1);  // 60% speed, 2 sec/side, clockwise
        advancedDrone.hexagonSmooth(50, 1, -1);  // 50% speed, 1 sec/side, counter-clockwise

        advancedDrone.close();
    }
}
```

## ÔøΩ Important Implementation Notes

### **Circle Implementation**

The flight patterns in this library use **direct motor control** for true circles, leveraging the Java Drone class's `sendControl()` method to match Python functionality.

**Python Implementation (True Circles):**
```python
def circle(self, speed=75, direction=1):
    self.sendControl(0, speed, direction * speed, 0)  # Direct motor control
    time.sleep(5)
```

**Java Implementation (Direct Control):**
```java
// Direct motor control for true circles (similar to Python)
sendControl(0, speed, clockwise * speed, 0);
```

### **Educational Progression**

The library provides **two approaches** for geometric patterns to support different learning levels:

1. **Educational Discrete Methods** (`pentagon()`, `hexagon()`, `circleApproximation()`):
   - Use high-level `go()` commands  
   - Show students how to break complex shapes into simple movements
   - Teach geometric concepts and angle calculations
   - Good for introductory programming courses

2. **Python-Style Smooth Methods** (`pentagonSmooth()`, `hexagonSmooth()`, `circle()`, `spiral()`):
   - Use direct motor control with `sendControl()` and `sendControlWhile()`
   - Match Python implementation exactly
   - Provide smooth, continuous movement
   - Good for advanced courses and cross-language consistency

This dual approach lets instructors choose the right method for their course level and learning objectives.

### **Additional Features to Consider**

While the basic circle implementation is now available, we can expand with:
- Polygon approximation methods for comparison
- Variable-speed circles (accelerating/decelerating)
- Both direct control and approximation options for educational comparison
