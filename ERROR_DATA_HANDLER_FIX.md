# Error Data Handler Fix

## Issue Discovery

When testing the ErrorMonitoringExample in connect mode, error data was never received despite successful drone connection. The connection could read other data types (Model, Firmware, Battery) but `linkManager.getError()` always returned null.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Path
1. Verified `getErrors()` delegates to `getErrorData()` ✅
2. Confirmed `getErrorData()` calls `sendRequest(DataType.Error)` ✅  
3. Confirmed delay and wait logic working correctly ✅
4. Found `linkManager.getError()` returns null ❌

### Root Cause
The `Receiver` class was missing a handler for `DataType.Error` in the `initializeHandlers()` method. Without this handler, when Error messages were received from the drone, they were never stored in the `LinkManager`.

**Evidence:**
- Receiver.java line 73-100: `initializeHandlers()` had handlers for State, Information, Attitude, Position, etc., but **no handler for Error**
- LinkManager.java line 15: `private Error error;` field existed but was never populated
- LinkManager.java line 34-39: `getError()` and `setError()` methods existed but `setError()` was never called

## Solution

Added the missing Error handler to the Receiver's handler initialization:

```java
handlers.put(DataType.Error, msg -> linkManager.setError((com.otabi.jcodroneedu.protocol.linkmanager.Error) msg));
```

**Location:** Receiver.java, line 95 (added after DataType.Count handler, before DataType.Address handler)

## Implementation Details

The Error protocol class (`protocol/linkmanager/Error.java`) already existed with:
- Proper serialization/deserialization (`pack()` and `unpack()` methods)
- Three fields: `systemTime`, `errorFlagsForSensor`, `errorFlagsForState`
- Size constant: `ERROR_SIZE = 16` bytes

The handler follows the same pattern as other LinkManager data types:
```java
handlers.put(DataType.Information, msg -> {
    Information info = (Information) msg;
    linkManager.setInformation(info);
    inventoryManager.updateInformation(info);
});

handlers.put(DataType.Error, msg -> linkManager.setError((com.otabi.jcodroneedu.protocol.linkmanager.Error) msg));
```

Note: Error data only needs to update LinkManager, not InventoryManager, so the handler is simpler.

## Testing Status

**Build Status:** ✅ Compiles successfully

**Testing Notes:**
- Handler added and verified to compile
- Error data reception requires active drone connection
- Connection verification must succeed (State ready + Info available)
- When testing, ensure:
  - Drone is powered on
  - Drone is paired to controller
  - Controller is connected to computer via USB

### Modified
- `src/main/java/com/otabi/jcodroneedu/receiver/Receiver.java` - Added Error handler

### Related (No changes needed)
- `src/main/java/com/otabi/jcodroneedu/protocol/linkmanager/Error.java` - Protocol class (already complete)
- `src/main/java/com/otabi/jcodroneedu/LinkManager.java` - Storage class (already had getter/setter)
- `src/main/java/com/otabi/jcodroneedu/Drone.java` - API methods (already correctly implemented)

## Educational Value

This fix demonstrates an important pattern in protocol handling:
1. **Protocol Definition** - Error.java defines the data structure
2. **Storage** - LinkManager holds the current Error state
3. **API** - Drone provides methods to request and retrieve error data
4. **Handler Registration** - Receiver must register a handler to connect received messages to storage

The missing handler broke the chain at step 4, preventing the protocol message from reaching the storage layer even though all other components were correctly implemented.

## Next Steps

With the Error handler now registered:
1. Test connect mode with properly paired drone
2. Verify error data is received in all 6 examples
3. Test fly mode for actual flight operations
4. Validate emergency landing logic activates on low battery
