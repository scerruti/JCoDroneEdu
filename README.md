🎓 **Educational Java API for CoDrone EDU** - A comprehensive programming interface designed specifically for robotics education with full Python API parity, extensive sensor support, LED control, flight patterns, and AP Computer Science A compliance.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

The CoDrone EDU Java API aims to provide educators and students with a robust, classroom-ready programming interface that matches the functionality and ease of use of the official Python API while leveraging Java's educational benefits for AP Computer Science A and university-level courses.

## ✨ Planned Features

### 🚁 **Core Flight Control**
- **Movement Commands**: `go()`, distance-based movement (`moveForward()`, `moveBackward()`, etc.)
- **Advanced Navigation**: Absolute positioning, custom flight patterns
- **Educational Patterns**: Squares, triangles, spirals, and custom choreography

### 🌈 **LED & Visual Control**
- **Drone LEDs**: Full RGB color control with educational color mixing
- **Controller LEDs**: Synchronized lighting effects
- **Pattern Modes**: Solid colors, blinking, rainbow effects, and custom sequences

### 📡 **Comprehensive Sensor Suite**
- **Motion Sensors**: Accelerometer, gyroscope, angle detection
- **Distance Sensors**: Range finding (front, back, left, right, top, bottom)
- **Color Sensors**: RGB detection, HSV data, front/back sensor access
- **Environmental**: Battery monitoring, flight state tracking

### 🎓 **Educational Integration**
- **AP CSA Compliance**: Aligned with College Board curriculum standards
- **Progressive Complexity**: From basic commands to advanced robotics concepts
- **Python Compatibility**: Familiar method names for students transitioning between languages
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Educational context, example projects, and best practices

## 🏗️ Current Development Status

### ✅ **Completed Components**
- Core flight control (`go()` method and movement patterns)
- Distance-based movement methods with unit support
- Complete LED control system (drone and controller)
- Essential sensor access (motion, range, battery)
- Color sensor implementation with Python API parity
- Flight pattern library with inheritance demonstration
- Comprehensive test suites (134+ test cases)

### 🚧 **In Development**
