🎓 **Educational Java API for CoDrone EDU** - A comprehensive programming interface designed specifically for robotics education with full Python API parity, extensive sensor support, LED control, flight patterns, and AP Computer Science A compliance.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

The CoDrone EDU Java API aims to provide educators and students with a robust, classroom-ready programming interface that matches the functionality and ease of use of the official Python API while leveraging Java's educational benefits for AP Computer Science A and university-level courses.

## ✨ Planned Features

### 🚁 **Core Flight Control**
- **Movement Commands**: `go()`, distance-based movement (`moveForward()`, `moveBackward()`, etc.)
- **Advanced Navigation**: Absolute positioning, custom flight patterns
- **Educational Patterns**: Squares, triangles, spirals, and custom choreography

### 🌈 **LED & Visual Control**
- **Drone LEDs**: Full RGB color control with educational color mixing
- **Controller LEDs**: Synchronized lighting effects
- **Pattern Modes**: Solid colors, blinking, rainbow effects, and custom sequences

### 📡 **Comprehensive Sensor Suite**
- **Motion Sensors**: Accelerometer, gyroscope, angle detection
- **Distance Sensors**: Range finding (front, back, left, right, top, bottom)
- **Color Sensors**: RGB detection, HSV data, front/back sensor access
- **Environmental**: Battery monitoring, flight state tracking

### 🎓 **Educational Integration**
- **AP CSA Compliance**: Aligned with College Board curriculum standards
- **Progressive Complexity**: From basic commands to advanced robotics concepts
- **Python Compatibility**: Familiar method names for students transitioning between languages
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Educational context, example projects, and best practices

## 🏗️ Current Development Status

## Sensor scaling (canonical)

The project uses a canonical set of conversions for motion sensor data to avoid ambiguity across
examples, tests, and the public API. These constants live in `DroneSystem.SensorScales`.

- Accelerometer raw units: encoded as signed 16-bit integers where
	raw = m/s^2 * 10. Convert to m/s^2 by multiplying raw * 0.1 (or use
	`DroneSystem.SensorScales.ACCEL_RAW_TO_MS2`).
- To convert to G (approx): divide m/s^2 by 9.80665 (or use
	`DroneSystem.SensorScales.ACCEL_RAW_TO_G`).
- Angles: raw protocol values are already in degrees — no centi-degree scaling.

Please use the constants above for any conversion rather than hard-coded divisors
so the behavior stays consistent across the codebase.
