## Testing Best Practices Demonstrated

### 1. **Test Isolation**
- Each test is independent
- `@BeforeEach` restores clean state
- No shared mutable state between tests

### 2. **Clear Test Names**
- `@DisplayName` with descriptive names
- Format: "Category: specific behavior tested"
- Examples: "Builder rejects invalid frequency (negative)"

### 3. **Comprehensive Assertions**
- Both positive and negative test cases
- Edge cases covered (min/max values, nulls, empty)
- Error messages included in all assertions

### 4. **Thread Safety Testing**
- Real concurrent execution (not mocked)
- High thread counts (10-20 threads)
- Many operations (100-1000 per thread)
- Validates actual ConcurrentHashMap behavior

### 5. **Integration Test Safety**
- Battery level checks
- Sensor validation
- Manual confirmation prompts
- Clear abort instructions
- Comprehensive error handling

### 6. **Educational Focus**
- Tests demonstrate API usage patterns
- Star Wars theme shows engagement potential
- Comments explain what's being tested
- Readable test code serves as examples
