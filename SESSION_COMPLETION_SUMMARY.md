## 🎓 Educational Value

### Tests as Documentation
The unit tests serve as comprehensive API usage examples:

```java
// From BuzzerSequenceTest - demonstrates Builder pattern
BuzzerSequence starWars = new BuzzerSequence.Builder()
    .addNote(392, 350)   // G4
    .addNote(392, 350)   // G4
    .addNote(392, 350)   // G4
    .addNote(311, 250)   // Eb4
    .addPause(100)
    .addNote(466, 120)   // Bb4
    .addNote(392, 350)   // G4
    .build("star-wars");
```

### Real-World Test Scenarios
The integration tests demonstrate practical drone programming:

```java
// From AutonomousPingTest - combined autonomous + manual control
drone.takeoff();
drone.ping(0, 255, 0);  // Green = start

// Autonomous wall avoidance while strafing
Thread autonomousThread = new Thread(() -> drone.avoidWall(4, 70));
autonomousThread.start();
drone.setRoll(20);  // Add manual strafe
drone.move(3);

drone.keepDistance(4, 40);  // Switch to closer distance
drone.ping(0, 0, 255);  // Blue = complete
```

## 🔍 Testing Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Test Isolation** - Each test independent, clean state via `@BeforeEach`
2. **Clear Naming** - `@DisplayName` with descriptive behavior descriptions
3. **Comprehensive Coverage** - Positive, negative, edge cases, thread safety
4. **Safety First** - Integration tests have battery checks, confirmations, abort options
5. **Educational Focus** - Tests double as API usage examples
